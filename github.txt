NOTE for TA / person grading this
for globeTraveler, I tested the code on my laptop which has a resolution of about 3k by 2k, this scales the css different, where possible I used percentages to allivate
differences in resolution in the website, but this did not fix everything. So there are components that look larger than they should be or overlap, to fix this
/ to see the proper functionality of the website you might have to zoom the page out to about 50% at most (assuming you are using a lower resolution computer).
